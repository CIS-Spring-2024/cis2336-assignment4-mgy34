This project was created by Madison Young (ID: 2146526).

The project has 8 HTML files, 1 CSS file, and 1 Javascript file set up with Express and Node.JS.

The HTML files are as follow:
- About
- Contact
- FAQ
- Homepage
- Menu
- Order Confirmation
- Order Page
- Owner Biography

The CSS file is connected and referenced in all of the project, creating a uniformed header, footer, and minor details such as fonts across the webpage. 

To begin using the webpage as intended, please start with the file ownerbiography.html, and from there you are able to access and go between pages via the header or footer of the website. There is dynamic Javascript and HTML features across the page to make it pleasing to the eye and accessible. 

The backend Javascript can be accessed via the index.mjs file, in which a calculation of the cart total is attempted to be calculated. I admittedly could not get this to work, so apologies for that.

Thank you for a wonderful semester.

Note: I wasn't able to commit directly through Visual Studio, and GitHub does not allow me to upload more than 100 files at a time, so I uploaded my backend Javascript file directly, but the modules unfortunately were not able to carry over. I'll upload as many as I can before the deadline.
