        <!--Introduction-->
        <h2> Welcome to Cafe Ease!</h2>
        <p>Cafe Ease was a cafeteria intended for students to be able to lounge and spend time together while still having a quiet environment to study. 
            Having been a student herself, she knows that finding a safe and quiet place to study is difficult, with most cafeteria areas having lots of
            traffic. The only other place being to study at home leads to inevitable distractions, so there needed to be a place made on campus, and thus
            the idea of Cafe Ease came to life. The cafeteria has successfully run for over a year now, and Madison hopes the project continue to be a success.</p>
        
        <p>Madison Young has been interested in the art of business and food for as long as she has lived, having enjoyed visiting different cafes and restuarant.
            With the encouragement of her family and the dedication to creating a safe space for fellow students, she made her dreams of running a business a reality.
            Friends and strangers have complimented her devotion to curating a public space that encourages introversion and the importance of presence rather than socialization.</p>

        <p>In Madison's free time, she is an enthusiast of the arts, often hosting festivals or events based around celebrating culture and entertainment.
            She claims that "small businesses supporting small businesses is vital for the success of an establishment," and she is proven right over and over
            as the crowds continue to file in during these celebrations.</p>

        <p>When not working towards the cafeteria, Madison spends her time helping others and encouraging others to follow their own dreams.</p>
